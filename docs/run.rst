Usage basics
============

|trex| is usually launched from the command-line (with or without parameters), which will show a file opening dialog. There is the possibility of starting it directly using a desktop short-cut (or double-clicking the executable itself), but this requires either a manual compile or changes to your environment variables (see :ref:`run-by-clicking`). Its younger sibling, |grabs|, also offers a graphical user interface, but can only be started from the terminal at the moment (we will be working on changing that, and also potentially integrating it completely with |trex|). The following sections address the issue of directly providing parameters using the command-line for both softwares (e.g. in a batch processing, or generally a more command-line affine use-case). Any additional number of parameters can be passed to both |grabs| and |trex| as::

	trex [...] -PARAMETER VALUE

For example, in order to set the number of individuals to 5 and prefix all individuals names/files with "termite" instead of "fish", just change the values of ``track_max_individuals`` and ``individual_prefix`` when launching the application like so (we are also opening a file called "example" and use a different settings file)::

	trex -i example -s tmp.settings -track_max_individuals 5 -individual_prefix "termite"

A full reference of available parameters for |trex| at :doc:`parameters_trex`.

If you're launching |trex| by double-clicking it (or using voice commands), most parameters (except system-variables) can be adjusted after loading a video.

This page is a reference for some commonly used parameters of our software. Some common real-life usage examples can be found at :doc:`examples`.

Basic principles & Good practices
---------------------------------

Both |grabs| and |trex| offer many parameters that can be set by users. However, that does not mean that all parameters have to be considered in all cases. In fact, most of them will already be set to reasonable values that work in many situations:

	*If there is no problem, do not change parameters.*
	
Otherwise, if your problem cannot be solved by repeatedly mashing the same sequence of buttons (but with an increasingly stern expression on your face), please consider the list of things that happen frequently in (:doc:`faq`).

Parameters are either changed directly as part of the command-line (using ``-PARAMETER VALUE``), in settings files or from within the graphical user interface (or magically). Settings files are called [VIDEONAME].settings, and located either in the same folder as the video, or in the output folder (``~/Videos`` by default, or set using the command-line option ``-d /folder/path``). These settings files are automatically loaded along with the video. Settings that were changed by command-line parameters can be saved by pressing ``menu -> save config``.

Command-line parameters always override settings files.

If you know the number of individuals, specify before you do the tracking (using the parameter ``track_max_individuals``).

When converting videos, :param:`meta_real_width` should always be specified unless you do not know the real-world dimensions of what you see. If not set, then all values will be in fictional units (``meta_real_width`` defaults to 30). This sets the :param:`cm_per_pixel` parameter for the current video to ``meta_real_width / video-width``. However, in newer versions you can set ``cm_per_pixel`` within the |trex| GUI. Simply click into an empty spot of the arena, hold CTRL/âŒ˜ and click somewhere else: a button will pop up to define the selected length as a specific real-world length. See here: `changing the cm to px conversion factor <https://trex.run/docs/gui.html#changing-the-cm-px-conversion-factor>`_.

Consecutive segments
--------------------

Tracking in |trex| heavily relies on consecutively tracked trajectory pieces. These are often called "segments" or "consecutive segments" here. You can find them in |trex| by selecting an individual and looking at the top-left info card. There it should display frame numbers - with the current frame marked with a line. This moves up when the displayed range of frames (e.g. 1234-1300, or 1234 for a single frame) no longer contains the frame currently viewed in |trex|.

These segments usually end in these situations:

	- the individual cannot be found in a frame (e.g. because it has moved farther than :param:`track_max_speed`)
	- the individual has not moved too far, but close to too far (90% of ``track_max_speed``)
	- multiple individuals were expected in the vicinity of too few objects and cannot be separated via thresholding, so it'd rather not track anything to be sure (e.g. when individuals overlap)
	- is has actually disappeared

If these segments end in other situations, then there is a good chance that some parameters need to be changed. See :ref:`parameter-order` for more information.

Using settings files
--------------------

[TODO] But basically the format is::

	parameter_name = value
	parameter2 = value2

If you save this as videoname.settings in your output directory (e.g. ``~/Videos`` by default), |trex| will load these settings before any command-line parameters. Command-line, however, always overwrites .settings files.

Running TGrabs
--------------

Running |grabs| usually involves the following parameters::

	tgrabs -i [SOURCE] -o [DESTINATION] [ADDITIONAL]

**Source** can be any of the following:

* **basler**: A Basler camera. This can be followed up by :code:`-cam_serial_number [SERIAL]` if multiple cameras are attached.
* **webcam**: A generic webcam, e.g. attached via USB or integrated into the computer.
* **files**: Path to a video file, or an array of video files like :code:`-i [FILE1,FILE2,...,FILEN]` which are going to be concatenated in the order they appear.
* **pattern**: A patterned path to where the video file is located. This could be, e.g. :code:`-i /path/to/video/%6d.mp4` to indicate that the video-files are named :code:`000000.mp4` to any number :code:`XXXXXX.mp4`. If the video starts at a number higher than zero, one can attach :code:`-i /path/to/video/%6.S.E.mp4` to indicate start (:code:`S`) and end (:code:`E`) indexes.
* **interactive**: Is a test environment, generating a number of individuals based on the tracking parameter :code:`track_max_individuals` and a set :code:`frame_rate` (:code:`25` by default).

**Destination** is expected to be either a full path, or the name of the video (without extension). This will save a :code:`DESTINATION.pv` video file in the :code:`~/Videos/` folder.

**Additional** can be any number of parameters -- be it for tracking or image processing. A full reference of available parameters for |trex| can be found at :doc:`parameters_trex`.

If multiple files match the **pattern**, then they will be concatenated into one long video. This can be useful for videos that have been split into many small parts, or just a convenient way of e.g. training visual identification on multiple videos of the same individuals.

If there are ``[XXXXX].npz`` files (named exactly like the video files but with a different extension) in the video folder, then |grabs| will attempt to use them for frame-timestamps. The format of these files is expected to be::

	- 'frame_time': an array of N doubles for all N frames in the video segment
	- 'imgshape': a tuple of integers (width, height) of the video
	
Other useful options are::

	- 'meta_real_width': The width of what is seen in the video in cms. This is used to convert px -> cm internally, and is saved as meta information inside the .pv file.
	- 'meta_species': Species (meta-information, entirely optional)

See also: :param:`meta_real_width`.

Running TRex
------------

The tracker only expects an input file::

	trex -i [VIDEONAME]

``VIDEONAME`` is either a full path to the video file, or the name of a video file in the default output folder (``~/Videos`` by default). This will open |trex| with all settings set to default, except if there is a ``[VIDEONAME].settings`` file present next to the video file or in the default output folder.

Just like with |grabs|, you can attach any number of additional parameters to the command-line, simply using ``-PARAMETER VALUE`` (see :doc:`parameters_trex`).

.. _parameter-order:

Setting parameters in the correct order
---------------------------------------

Preferably set parameters in this order (with the goal to only match those objects that are your objects of interest, and exclude the ones that you do not want to track):

	- :param:`cm_per_pixel` (in .settings files, command-line or in |trex|) / :param:`meta_real_width` (during conversion)
	- :param:`track_threshold`
	- :param:`track_size_filter`

Now all objects of interest should have a cyan number next to them in RAW view (pressing ``D`` in tracking view switches to RAW and vice-versa). More "optional" parameters like can now be set in order to maximize the length of consecutive segments:

	- :param:`track_max_speed`
	- :param:`track_max_reassign_time`
	- :param:`track_posture_threshold`
	- :param:`outline_resample`
	- :param:`outline_curvature_range_ratio`

Other command-line tools
------------------------

Another tool is included, called ``pvinfo``, which can be used programmatically (e.g. in jupyter notebooks) to retrieve information about converted videos and the settings used to track them::

	$ pvinfo -i <VIDEO> -print_parameters [analysis_range,video_size] -quiet
	analysis_range = [1000,50000]
	video_size = [3712,3712]
	
If no settings (apart from ``-i <pv-videopath>``) are provided, it displays some information on the PV file::

	$ pvinfo -i group_1
	[15:24:00] pv::File<V6, 182.97MB, '/Users/tristan/Videos/group_1', [3712 x 3712], 19317 frames, no mask>
	
	crop_offsets: [0,0,0,0]
	Time of recording: 'Tue Apr 28 06:42:28 2020'
	Length of recording: '00d:00h:10m:03s'
	Framerate: 32fps (31.25ms)
	
	Metadata: {"meta_species": "Zebrafish", "meta_age_days": 25, "meta_conditions": "", "meta_misc": "", "cam_limit_exposure": 5500, "meta_real_width": 30, "meta_source_path": "/media/nvme/group_1.avi", "meta_cmd": " ./tgrabs -i /media/nvme/group_1.avi -s /media/nvme/convert_group_1.settings -enable_live_tracking", "meta_build": "<hash>", "meta_conversion_time": "28-04-2020 06:42:09", "frame_rate": 32}

It can be useful for retrieving values of tracking parameters from external scripts, like in python (also things like ``video_size``)::

	def get_parameter(video, parameter, root = "", prefix = "", conda_env = "", info_path = "pvinfo"):
	    """Uses the pvinfo utility to retrieve information about tracked videos.
	    This information is usually saved in the .pv files / .settings / .results files.
	    The pvinfo utility will emulate a call to TRex + loading existing .results files
	    and settings files in the same order.
    
	    Parameters
	    ----------
	    video : str
	            Name of the video, or absolute path to the video
	    parameter : str
	            Name of the parameter to retrieve (see https://trex.run/docs/parameters_trex.html)
	    root : str, optional
	            Either empty (default), or path to the folder the video is in
	    prefix : str, optional
	            Either empty (default), or name of the output_prefix to be used
	    conda_env : path, optional
	            Either empty (default), or an absolute path to the conda environment in which pvinfo is installed 
	            (e.g. C:\\Users\\Tristan\\Anaconda3\\envs\\tracking)
	    info_path : str
	            Absolute path to the pvinfo utility executable

	    Returns
	    -------
	    object
	            The return type is determined by the type of the parameter requested
	    """

	    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
	    import os
	    import ast
    
	    if len(conda_env) > 0:
	        if info_path == "pvinfo":
	            info_path = conda_env+os.sep+"bin"+os.sep+"pvinfo"
	    parameter_list = [info_path]
	    if root != "":
	            parameter_list += ["-d",root]
	    if prefix != "":
	            parameter_list += ["-p", prefix]

	    parameter_list += ["-i", video,"-quiet", "-print_parameters","["+parameter+"]"]

	    my_env = os.environ.copy()
	    if len(conda_env) > 0:
	        my_env["CONDA_PREFIX"] = conda_env
	        my_env["PATH"] = conda_env+";"+conda_env+os.sep+"bin;"+my_env["PATH"]

	    process = Popen(parameter_list, stdout=PIPE, env=my_env)
	    (output, err) = process.communicate()
	    exit_code = process.wait()
	    if exit_code == 0:
	        return ast.literal_eval(output.decode("utf-8").split("=")[-1][1:-1])
	    raise Exception("Cannot retrieve "+parameter+" from "+video+": "+output.decode("utf-8")+" ("+str(exit_code)+") "+" ".join(parameter_list))

But it has many other uses, too! For example, it can be used to save heatmap information that can be visualized in |trex| (but can not currently be saved directly from |trex| -> will be soon)::

	pvinfo -i video -heatmap -heatmap_source SPEED -heatmap_resolution 128 -heatmap_frames 100 -heatmap_dynamic
	
Or to display information about objects inside the saved frames::

	$ pvinfo -i <VIDEO> -blob_detail -quiet
	[15:24:07] 190315246 bytes (190.32MB) of blob data
	[15:24:07] Images average at 512.654519 px / blob and the range is [2-2154] with a median of 616.
	[15:24:07] There are 10 blobs in each frame (median).

.. _run-by-clicking:

Run software directly using shortcuts
-------------------------------------

Interaction with software on Unix-systems often takes place within a terminal. Under Windows, a lot of the typical interactions take place within a graphical user interface -- however, especially when installed within a conda environment, some additional environment variables need to be set. I am unsure whether this may influence other software or applications, so starting directly from the Anaconda3 PowerShell terminal should be the preferred approach.

If you still want to go the dangerous path, e.g. under Windows 10, you can adjust your environment variables by right-clicking "This Computer" -> "Properties" -> "Advanced System Settings" -> "Environment variables". Inside the "System variables" box, if it does not contain the variable "CONDA_PREFIX" yet, click on "New" to add it. Example::

	Name of the variable: CONDA_PREFIX
	Value of the variable: C:\Users\tristan\Anaconda3\envs\tracking

If it already exists, change the value accordingly. Now you should be able to create a Desktop shortcut for TRex and start it with a double-click.
